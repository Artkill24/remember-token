# Remember Token Tokenomics
## Economic Design for Sustainable Social Impact

**Version 1.0 | January 2025**

---

## Overview

Remember Token ($RMEM) implements a carefully designed economic model that incentivizes genuine human care while ensuring long-term protocol sustainability. Unlike speculative tokens, $RMEM derives its value from real-world social utility and meaningful human interactions.

## Token Fundamentals

### Basic Information
- **Name**: Remember Token
- **Symbol**: $RMEM
- **Standard**: ERC-20 (Base Chain)
- **Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 tokens (Fixed, No Inflation)
- **Decimals**: 18
- **Contract Address**: `[To be filled after deployment]`

### Key Characteristics
- **Fixed Supply**: No new tokens can be created beyond initial 1B supply
- **Utility-Driven**: Primary value from social interactions, not speculation
- **Burn Mechanism**: Potential future burning of unused treasury tokens
- **Governance Token**: Holders vote on protocol parameters and upgrades

- Expected volume: $10-50M annually by year 3
- Creates consistent buying pressure

**Gift Economy**:
- Users gifting tokens for special occasions
- Token-based tips for exceptional caring
- Creates circular economy of appreciation

**Staking & DeFi Integration**:
- Tokens locked in staking contracts reduce supply
- Yield farming opportunities in broader DeFi
- Borrowing against token collateral

## Economic Security & Anti-Gaming

### Daily Limits System

**Individual Daily Limit**: 100,000 $RMEM maximum per user per day
- Prevents industrial farming operations
- Allows genuine heavy users (counselors, community leaders)
- Resets at midnight UTC

**Global Daily Emission**: 500,000 $RMEM maximum across all users
- Ensures predictable token release schedule
- Creates scarcity and competitive earning
- Adjustable via governance

### Anti-Gaming Measures

**Relationship Verification**:
- Diminishing returns for repeated same-address interactions
- Requires variety in social connections
- Prevents self-dealing and circular farming

**Temporal Restrictions**:
- Memory creation costs gas fees (economic barrier)
- Verification windows prevent retroactive gaming
- Rate limiting on memory creation frequency

**Social Graph Analysis**:
- AI monitors for suspicious interaction patterns
- Community reporting and verification
- Automatic penalties for detected gaming

**Economic Barriers**:
- Gas fees for transactions
- Opportunity cost of time and attention
- Reputation risks for bad actors

### Slashing Mechanisms

**Verified Fraud**: -50% of earned tokens in past 30 days
**Gaming Detection**: -25% penalty + temporary suspension
**Community Reporting**: Investigation process with token recovery
**False Verification**: Both parties lose tokens + reputation damage

**Bear Market Resilience**:
- Core utility remains regardless of price
- Genuine users continue earning through caring
- Lower speculation, higher utility focus

**Long-term Equilibrium**:
- Price stabilizes around fundamental utility value
